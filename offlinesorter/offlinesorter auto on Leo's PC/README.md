Change the variable N_file, depending on how many data you have, in the creating_batch.py. And run the code to create sorting.bat.

Before running the .bat file, you must have done the whole sorting process once to make sure all parameter were right. And the run import.exe to make sure muase will go to the first .mcd file.
